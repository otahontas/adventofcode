# Advent of Code 2019 (C++)

Notes:
- Each `dayxx` -file contains solutions with explanations.
- Solutions also include basic tests against example inputs.
- Source file (i.e header & implementation) `aoc` contains aoc-spesific shared
classes and functions, such as I/O and IntCode computer.
- Source file (i.e header & implementation) `dsalgolib` contains different data
structures and algorithms that are used in solutions, but are not available in c++
standard library.
- Code style follows [Google C++ Style Guide](
https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
- To run spesific day, execute `make dayxx && ./dayxx`.
