# 2020

Python-based [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) solutions.
Couple of external libraries are used:
- the awesome [advent-of-code-data](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/)
library for getting input
- [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/) for some extra math functions

To install external libraries, use either [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
and `poetry install` or just plain `pip install .`.
