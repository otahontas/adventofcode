# Advent of code solutions

My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for different years, each
year implemented with different language. For each year, my goal has been to learn and
use languge-spesific coding conventions, idioms and project tools.

| Year | Language | Format | Project setup | Status |
| :--- | :------  | :----- | :------------ | : ---- | 
| 2019 | C++      | Single per per day, explanations as comments | Make / makefile | 10 / 25 |
| 2020 | Python   | One jupyter notebook, incl. explanations | Poetry / pyproject.toml | 25/25 |
| 2021 | Shell scripting (bash, awk, sed etc)| - | - | - |
