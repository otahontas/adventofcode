# Advent of code solutions

My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for different years, each
year implemented with different language. For each year, my goal has been to learn and
use language-specific coding conventions, idioms and project tools.

| Year | Language                             | Status  |
| :--- | :------                              | :----   |
| 2019 | C++                                  | 10 / 25 |
| 2020 | Python                               | 25 / 25 |
| 2021 | Shell scripting (bash, awk, sed etc) | 1/25    |
