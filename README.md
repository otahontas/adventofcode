# Advent of code solutions

My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for different years, each
year implemented with different language. For each year, my goal has been to learn and
use languge-spesific coding conventions, idioms and project tools.

| Year | Language | Format | Project setup |
| :--- | :------- | :----- | :------------ |
| 2019 | C++      | C++ project with explanations in files | Make / makefile |
| 2020 | Python   | Jupyter notebook with full explanations | Poetry / pyproject.toml |
