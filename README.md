# Advent of code solutions

My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for different years, each
year implemented with different language. For each year, my goal has been to learn and
use language-specific coding conventions, idioms and project tools.

| Year | Language         |
| :--- | :------          |
| 2019 | C++              |
| 2020 | Python           |
| 2021 | Shell scripting  |
| 2022 | Typescript       |
